#  Python DSA & Mini Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of **Python programs** focused on **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** along with a few **real-world mini projects**.  
Each file is written in a **clear, beginner-friendly way** and is useful for **practice, interviews, and academic learning**.
